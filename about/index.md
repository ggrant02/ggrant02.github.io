Please excuse the mess while this site is under construction.

George Grant grew up in Maine, learning about the importance of nature and the systems that control our surroundings from his Dad. For his undergraduate education he majored in geology and biology (BS 2014); reinforcing the lessons of his childhood with the knowledge of biological and geological systems, which have shaped the earth around us. During a break in between undergraduate and graduate school, George worked for the US Forest Service in Hines, Oregon. Here he was able to put that knowledge to good use. While working there for two summers, he was tasked with protecting vulnerable fish and amphibian waterways while making it possible for valuable timber harvests to continue. Over the course of the two summers (2014 & 2015), George and his field partners discovered and rectified stream classifications on approximately 70,000 acres of the Malheur National Forest. During the winter of 2014-2015, George was fortunate to have the opportunity to work in the Chemical Informatics group at the US Food and Drug Administration (Silver Spring, Maryland). Here he was able to begin to hone writing skills that would become an integral part of his graduate career while working with cutting edge models to predict the toxicity of drug synthesis byproducts. These models made it possible to target specific byproducts for testing while saving time and money in synthesis and isolation.

In the fall of 2015 George began at the Ohio State University as a graduate fellow, a select group of students that showed excellence during undergraduate and post-baccalaureate employment. The primary project that he is working on seeks to understand the significance and impact of climate change on a Pliocene forest site in the Canadian Arctic. This site is dominated by large, woody debris of exquisitely preserved tree specimens. These specimens have been preserved in the polar desert of the Canadian Arctic since deposition about 3 million years ago. Since starting at Ohio State, George has been successful with 7 grants and scholarships, and 1 large scale crowdfunding campaign. Three of these grants funded an expedition to the fossil forest site on Ellesmere Island for a field sampling trip during the summer of 2016. Most recently, a $5000 grant to characterize the chemical remains (biomarkers) of a Pliocene forest deposit was secured and lab work is planned for the spring of 2019. This project is intended to make up one of the chapters in his dissertation. Other projects include examination of tree ring isotopes to build climate predictions and carbon cycling enzymes.

Since the fall of 2016, George has been a teaching assistant in the School of Earth Sciences. He has primarily in the Earth Through Time course (ES1122) and currently serves as Head TA. He has also substitute lectured in Planet Earth: How it Works (ES1100), Geology of the National Parks (1105), and The Dynamic Earth (ES1121). The Head TA position has allowed him to refine both management and teaching skills. He manages an assistant who helps with , while also developing, improving upon, and organizing grading the weekly labs and preparing lab materials and samples. George was a nominee for a school-wide Teaching Assistant Award in the fall of 2017 and has had numerous interactions with the chair of the graduate committee commending his teaching.

In his spare time George enjoys spending time outside with his partner, Lienne. They are especially interested in rock climbing, gardening, backpacking, skiing, and paddling.
